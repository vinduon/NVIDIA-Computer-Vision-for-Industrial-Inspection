    "Once we are satisfied with our model, we can move to deployment. `classification` includes an `export` subtask to export and prepare a trained classification model for deployment. Exporting the model decouples the training process from deployment and allows conversion to TensorRT engines outside the TAO environment. TensorRT engines are specific to each hardware configuration and should be generated for each unique inference environment. This may be interchangeably referred to as the `.trt` or `.engine` file. The same exported TAO model may be used universally across training and deployment hardware. This is referred to as the `.etlt` file, or encrypted TAO file. "

    "## Introduction to Triton Inference Server ##\n",
    "NVIDIA [Triton Inference Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server) simplifies the deployment of AI models at scale in production. Triton is an open-source, inference-serving software that lets teams deploy trained AI models from any framework, from local storage, or from Google Cloud Platform or Azure on any GPU or CPU-based infrastructure, cloud, data center, or edge. The below figure shows the Triton Inference Server high-level architecture. The model repository is a _file-system based repository_ of the models that Triton will make available for inferencing. Inference requests arrive at the server via either [HTTP/REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), [gRPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC), or by the C API and are then routed to the appropriate per-model scheduler. Triton implements multiple scheduling and batching algorithms that can be configured on a model-by-model basis. Each model's scheduler optionally performs batching of inference requests and then passes the requests to the backend corresponding to the model type. The backend performs inferencing using the inputs provided in the batched requests to produce the requested outputs. The outputs are then returned.\n",

    "We've also installed the Triton Inference Server Client libraries to provide APIs that make it easy to communicate with Triton from your C++ or Python application. Using these libraries, you can send either HTTP/REST or gRPC requests to Triton to access all its capabilities: inferencing, status and health, statistics and metrics, model repository management, etc. These libraries also support using system and CUDA shared memory for passing inputs to and receiving outputs from Triton. The easiest way to get the Python client library is to use `pip` to install the `tritonclient` module, as detailed below. For more details on how to download or build the Triton Inference Server Client libraries, you can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r20.12/docs/client_libraries.md), as well as examples that show the use of both the C++ and Python libraries.\n",

In our case, we need to perform normalization and mean subtraction to produce the final float planar data to the TensorRT engine for inferencing. We can get the `offsets` and `net-scale-factor` from the `nvinfer_config.txt` [file](tao_project/classification/export/nvinfer_config.txt). The pre-processing function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>y = net scale factor * (x-mean)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "where: \n",
    "* **x** is the input pixel value. It is an int8 with range [0,255]. \n",
    "* **mean** is the corresponding mean value, read either from the mean file or as offsets[c], where c is the channel to which the input pixel belongs, and offsets is the array specified in the configuration file. It is a float. \n",
    "* **net-scale-factor** is the pixel scaling factor specified in the configuration file. It is a float.\n",
    "* **y** is the corresponding output pixel value. It is a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:<br>\n",
    "* Execute the below cell to load one random **defect** sample. \n",
    "* Modify the `<FIXME>`s only and execute the cell below to pre-process the input image. "
