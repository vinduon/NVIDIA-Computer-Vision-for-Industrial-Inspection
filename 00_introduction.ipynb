    "Welcome to the NVIDIA DLI *Computer Vision for Industrial Inspection* workshop. In this lab, you will learn how to design, train, test, and deploy a hardware-accelerated manufacturing defect detection pipeline for industrial inspection using deep learning-based computer vision techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Explore various applications of deep learning-based computer vision for optical inspection across industries such as construction, manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, and agriculture.\n",
    "* Learn the end-to-end development of a deep learning model for the purpose of manufacturing defect classification.\n",
    "* Extract meaningful insights from a production dataset to ascertain the scope of the project.\n",
    "* Apply transfer-learning to build a custom defect classification model.\n",
    "* Fine-tune the deep learning model and evaluate various performance metrics.\n",
    "* Deploy the model and measure inference performance.\n",
    "* Experiment with various inference configurations to optimize performance.\n",

    "For this hands-on lab, we use [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to manage our environment.  The [JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html) is a dashboard that provides access to interactive iPython notebooks, as well as the folder structure of our environment and a terminal window into the Ubuntu operating system. The first view you will see includes a **menu bar** at the top, a **file browser** in the **left sidebar**, and a **main work area** that is initially open to this \"introduction\" notebook. \n",
    "<p><img src=\"images/jl_launcher.png\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "* The file browser can be navigated just like any other file explorer. A double click on any of the items will open a new tab with its content. \n",
    "* The main work area includes tabbed views of open files that can be closed, moved, and edited as needed. \n",
    "* The notebooks, including this one, consist of a series of content and code **cells**. To execute code in a code cell, press `Shift+Enter` or the `Run` button in the menu bar above, while a cell is highlighted. Sometimes, a content cell will get switched to editing mode. Executing the cell with `Shift+Enter` or the `Run` button will switch it back to a readable form.\n",
    "* To interrupt cell execution, click the `Stop` button in the menu bar or navigate to the `Kernel` menu, and select `Interrupt Kernel`. \n",
    "* We can use terminal commands in the notebook cells by prepending an exclamation point/bang(`!`) to the beginning of the command. "
